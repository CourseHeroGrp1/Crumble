# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Stephanie D., Abhiraj C., Gevork M.**

## Problem Statement

A majority of people don't bother writing down their family history because it is too tedious or difficult to do it by hand. In addition, they might just want a place to store all their family info (i.e. birthdays, relationships, anniversaries, etc.). A family tree that contains information about each member is a great way to do that.

## User Roles

- Individual: a user who wants to use a family tree as a way to deepen their relationships, to know who they are related to, or just to keep track of their family hisory.

## User Personas

- Billy is a teenager who lives in the suburbs of Los Angeles, California. Billy is learning about genetics and how traits are passed down through a person’s family heritage. In order to complete his class project, Billy needs to create a family tree and document the different characteristics of his family members and record how each family member is related. 

- Susan is a middle aged woman living with her husband in a rural town in Idaho. Susan’s youngest son’s baby was just born which has gotten her thinking about her family and how much it has grown. She decides that she wants to create a collection of various pictures, documents, and memories about her family and possibly gift it to her children. 

- A senior citizen who lives away from family and has dementia, and just wants to remember who their family is. Using photos as memory tools can help improve their social interactions and make equitable conversations more possible.
