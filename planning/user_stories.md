## Problem Statement

Managing large-scale projects or assignments is difficult due to complex scope and competing priorities. Our goal is to provide a versatile web planning tool that allows users to easily view their deadlines/deliverables by organizing large assignments into smaller, digestible tasks.


## User Roles

- Individual: a user who wants to be productive in their daily lives with the help of our application.

## User Personas

- Billy is a sophomore who goes to UCLA. Billy is a Computer Science student and wants to manage the different projects/assignments along with preparing for technical interviews. In order to be productive and not procrastinate, Billy wants to have a central manager which has all his notes and information for each of his classes.
 

- Susan is a middle aged woman working as a project manager. Susanâ€™s team is undertaking a large project and wants to have an effective management system to keep track of the various moving parts. Susan needs to create and share a tool with a work-rest daily schedule, kanban-style todos and overview for future meetings.
