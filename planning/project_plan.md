# Project Plan

Pod Members: **Stephanie D., Abhiraj C., Gevork M.**

## Problem Statement and Description

### Problem Statement
Managing large-scale projects or assignments is difficult due to complex scope and competing priorities. Our goal is to provide a versatile web planning tool that allows users to easily view their deadlines/deliverables by organizing large assignments into smaller, digestible tasks.

### Description
The purpose of this app is to provide users a platform that helps users be more productive and at the same time reminds them to take breaks while working. Key features include adding main tabs and subtabs for each different category of work and using the pomodoro timer to further increase productivity. Each tab contains a calendar side by side with daily/weekly to-do lists, a notes section, and a running timer for the pomodoro in nav bar.


## User Roles and Personas

### User Roles
- Individual: a user who wants to be productive in their daily lives with the help of our application.

### User Personas
- Billy is a sophomore who goes to UCLA. Billy is a Computer Science student and wants to manage the different projects/assignments along with preparing for technical interviews. In order to be productive and not procrastinate, Billy wants to have a central manager which has all his notes and information for each of his classes.
 
- Susan is a middle aged woman working as a project manager. Susanâ€™s team is undertaking a large project and wants to have an effective management system to keep track of the various moving parts. Susan needs to create and share a tool with a work-rest daily schedule, kanban-style todos and overview for future meetings.
