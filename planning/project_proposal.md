## Problem Statement

A majority of people don't bother writing down their family history because it is too tedious or difficult to do it by hand. 

## Description

The purpose of this project is to help users easily create and store a family tree. Key features will include the ability to add related family members using a form, adding more details to an individual, and displaying tree using visual nodes and connections. Target users will be able to create family trees and have them stored in a database which is easier and more reliable than doing it by hand. 

## Expected Features List

- Text Display of each individual's name
  - Button in each node for adding parents and children of an individual 
  - Button in each node for adding extra details about an individual
  - Possible Extra Details:
    - Birthday 
    - Occupation 
    - Physical features
    - Location
    - Description Area - free write text box
- Ability to color code each person's node to user's liking
- Login and Register feature to keep your tree private and saved
- Search feature to give users the ability to look up specific individuals in the tree
- Ability to create multiple trees and save them 
- Ability to drag and connect individual nodes manually to different nodes 

### Stretch
- If another member in the tree is mentioned in a description, users should be able to click their name and see details about them
