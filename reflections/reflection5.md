## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast) 
  - It was a little fast but it was enough pressure to get things done and develop a polished app!

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?
  - Our plan didn't change that much over the course of development except when one of the reviewers mentioned their concerns of having a grid calendar view for our events. So we decided to just do a list view instead. If we were to start over, we would probably commit the dev branch to the prod branch more often.

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?
  - Honestly, all of the labs and weekly assignments were extremely helpful in preparing us to create our capstone project. Although, the Heroku/Surge deployment lab was confusing for windows users.

* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)
  - Mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, sprint planning, bug bash, and  practice demo day.
